                <p>Welcome to my page! I am a Georgia native and up and coming developer. 
                   I have spent most of my adult life in the retail and restaurant industries. 
                   Having worked in hospitality for a long time I am ready to take my life 
                   and abilities into new territory. Some of my hobbies include running and 
                   video editing.
